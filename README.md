============================================================================================

Requires CoreTemp, HWiNFO, and MSIAfterburner (including MSIAfterburner.dll Rainmeter plugin)

Updated for the new HWiNFO 7 Gadget and Registry method, see this post: https://docs.rainmeter.net/tips/hwinfo/

You will most likely have to edit the skin to reflect the correct HWiNFO sensor(s) index(es) in your system as per the above Rainmeter doc. The skin is written with the assumption that "CPU Clocks" is at Index1, but your system may be different, depending on how you configure the HWiNFO Gagdet settings.
