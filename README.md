# mon0meters
Rainmeter skin suite inspired by NZXT CAM, for use on a dedicated sensor panel.

CPU, GPU, RAM, and Network Rainmeter skins, meant to be displayed on a 5in 1280x720 dedicated sensor panel.

Requires CoreTemp, HWiNFO, and MSIAfterburner (including MSIAfterburner.dll Rainmeter plugin)

Updated for the new HWiNFO 7 Gadget and Registry method, see this post: https://docs.rainmeter.net/tips/hwinfo/

You may have to edit the skin to reflect the correct sensor(s) in your system as per the above Rainmeter doc. The skin is written with the assumption that "CPU Clocks" is at Index1, but your system may be different.
