## Requirements: 
* [CoreTemp](https://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/)
* [HWiNFO](https://www.hwinfo.com/download/)
* [MSIAfterburner](https://www.msi.com/Landing/afterburner/graphics-cards) (including [MSIAfterburner.dll](https://forums.guru3d.com/threads/rainmeter-plugin-for-msi-afterburner.319558/) Rainmeter plugin)

Updated for the new HWiNFO 7 Gadget and Registry method, see the documentation here: [Using HWiNFO with Rainmeter](https://docs.rainmeter.net/tips/hwinfo/)

You will most likely have to edit the skin to reflect the correct HWiNFO sensor(s) index(es) in your system as per the above Rainmeter doc. The skin is written with the assumption that "CPU Clocks" is at Index1, but your system may be different, depending on how you configure the HWiNFO Gagdet settings.

## Installation:
1. Download the .zip and unzip/extract it
2. Copy the extracted "mon0meters" folder to your Documents\Rainmeter\Skins folder
3. Click "Refresh all" in Rainmeter to see the new folder
4. Load the skins
